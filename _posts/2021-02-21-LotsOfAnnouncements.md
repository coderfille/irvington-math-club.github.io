**2/24 Meeting ðŸ˜Ž**

This Wednesday, weâ€™ll be doing a HUGE contest review where weâ€™ll be going over problems from the last 2 months! This will give you a chance to figure out any mistakes (or learn to solve problems faster) on the previous few CAMLâ€™s, ASMAâ€™s, and At-Pacâ€™s, so make sure that you attend!

Visit https://irvingtonmath.club/contestreview to see all of the questions we will be going over, and select any problems youâ€™re interested in reviewing beforehand.

**Guts Round with American High School ðŸ§ª**

Over the past month, our officer team has been working with other schools to write and organize a Guts Round contest!

The contest will be individual (no teams) and will open on February 22nd. Students will have between the 22nd and February 28th to complete the questions.
