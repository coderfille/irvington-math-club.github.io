As-salaam 'alaikum, 

Welcome to a new year everyone! To start off 2021, here are a couple of things coming up:

<b>Wednesday Meeting ðŸ”®</b>  

This week during our weekly meeting, Rishabh will be providing an immensely captivating lecture on the Power of a Point! 


<b>Mathleague Discontinuation ðŸ˜¥</b>

Due to a lack of interest, we are very sorry to say that we will no longer be organizing sign-ups for the Mathleague competitions for the 2020-2021 school year. If you have already qualified for the State Mathleague, more information will be given about that at a later time. The last Mathleague we will help organize will be the one on January 9th, 2021. 

Shakar, 

  The Irvington Math Club Officer Team
