<b>12/2 Meeting</b> ðŸŽ„  
Join us for our first meeting next week, where Ananya will present a very exciting lecture by her and Vennela on how to creatively use trigonometric functions to solve problems!

<b>Contests Batch 2</b> ðŸ“ˆ  
Due to demand, we have decided to reopen lunch contests for 2021. Once updated in the ihsvikings.org/shop/math-club page, you can register for the remainder of CAML, ASMA, and At-Pac at a discounted price, and begin taking contests after January 1st.
1. CAML: $1.50
2. ASMA: $2.00
3. AT-PAC: $2.00
This is only for people who have not yet registered for lunch contests! (i.e. if you are already taking the contests, you may ignore this). 
Registration closes on December 15th!

<b>December Mathleague</b> ðŸ§¨   
Sign up for the potentially last Mathleague this year through IHS Math Club. The Mathleague contests have had very little interest in the last few months, so unless we get 6 sign-ups, this may be our last time registering for this contest!
