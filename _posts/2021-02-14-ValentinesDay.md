**2/17 Meeting ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜˜**

This week we will be having a fun Kahoot with questions about Valentineâ€™s Day to help all of you relax after a very stressful last few weeks! Make sure to come and have lots of fun with all of the new math club friends you made over the course of this year.

**Preview Questions ðŸ¥°ðŸ˜˜**

Try and solve this question beforehand so that you can be prepared for our kahoot: Jared has $180 and 24 gfâ€™s. If he gives his favorite gfâ€™s $8 and his other gfâ€™s $7, how many are his favorite?
