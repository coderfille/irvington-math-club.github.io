Hello Math Clubbers!

Yet another very exciting opportunity has come up for Irvington Math Club! HMMT, or the Harvard-MIT Math Tournament, is one of the most prestigious math tournaments of the year - one that we usually don't usually attend because of the distance. 

This year, HMMT is online, open to all high schoolers, and completely free, so IHS Math Club is now opening registration for anyone who is interested. HMMT will have a set of rounds/question papers that will be distributed to our school on November 14, and you/your team can work on it between 11/14 and 11/21. 

Please note that the weekend of 11/21-11/22 have multiple optional Guts Rounds and Educational Seminars that you may want to attend. The following links have the full schedule and more information about HMMT/individual rounds:

1. [Schedhule](hmmt.co/www/tournaments/schedule)

2. [Rules](hmmt.co/www/tournaments/rules)

3. [Testing](hmmt.co/www/tournaments/testing)

If you are interested, please sign up at Irvingtonmath.club/hmmtregister by October 14! No late sign-ups will be accepted, so please register ASAP! After you sign up, more information will be sent out and teams will be created. 

Thanks,
Irvington Math Club Team
