The CAML and ASMA contests will be offered again this year. Saturday mathleague.org contests will occur on Saturdays over Zoom. The AMC series of tests will occur online as well as Math Madness.

Some contests that we offered in past years include the At-Pac, Berkeley Math Tournament, Stanford Math Tournament, and SCVMA Field Day. These may or may not still happen this year.

Again, we do not have all of the details for all of these competitions, but stay tuned for more!

Some details are available in [Math Club Contest Dates 2020-2021](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ehVj0iMRoESxzUFZiQiqb0wf2EvOSqjZx1KnoG594DI/edit?usp=sharing), and you may consider adding the Irvington Math Club Calendar listed in the [about section of this site](/about).
