Hello everyone! ðŸ¦ƒðŸ¦ƒðŸ¦ƒ

<b>11/18 Meeting</b>  
Join us this week during lunch on Wednesday, November 18th, for a fun but short session of Countdown, the Kahoot version! Due to parent teacher conferences, Wednesday will be a shortened day, so the meeting will be held from 10:00 AM to 10:20 AM. Please have a device with you through which you can join our fun and amazing Kahoot! 

<b>Thanksgiving Week Update</b>   
In light of the upcoming week off full of gratefulness, we will NOT have a meeting during the Thanksgiving Break. Enjoy your break and stay relaxed!
