Great! You're considering joining Irvington Math Club. Joining comes with *no obligations*; it merely means that we will send you updates directly, so you don't have to check this website.

There are two ways to join:

 - Join [our Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ihsmathclub) (suggestion: follow the page to get timely updates). This is best if you check Facebook frequently.
 - Join [our Google group](https://groups.google.com/g/ihs-math-club) (suggestion: subscribe to "every new message;" we send emails on average about once per week). This is best if you check your email frequently.

If you filled out a Google Form recently to join, you will be added to the Google Group.

In addition, we recommend attending our [intro meeting](/events/2020/08/23/intro-meeting.html) on September 8th at 3pm.

We also have an [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ihsmath/), but we may not send all updates on it.
