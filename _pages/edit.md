We write the content for the pages in Markdown. It is mostly just plain text. You will have to [learn Markdown](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/) in order to write content for the site.

Conveniently edit on StackEdit using the following bookmarklets. Drag them to your bookmarks bar.

## Link account

To edit, visit the [Stack Edit App](https://stackedit.io/app#).

Click the <kbd>[Save Post]</kbd> bookmarklet twice to link StackEdit to your GitHub Account. Click <kbd>OK</kbd> then sign in or create a GitHub account to link it. Tell an organization admin (the person who is currently running the site) your username so they can add you to the organization to give you write access to the website.

Once the admin confirms that you have write access, you can edit the website.

## Editing an existing post

If you look at the [list of posts](https://github.com/irvington-math-club/irvington-math-club.github.io/tree/master/_posts), clicking a post then the <kbd>[Copy post path]</kbd> bookmarklet will copy the post path. Open StackEdit and click the <kbd>[Open post]</kbd> bookmarklet twice, then paste the file path in. Click <kbd>OK</kbd> to open the file.

## Making a new post

Inside StackEdit, click the <kbd>[Save post]</kbd> bookmarklet twice to open the save post dialog, then click on the "File path" input to name the file. Only edit the space between the date (e.g. `2019-08-18-`) and the extension (`.md`) It should be about the same as the title of the post but should not have any spaces: use hyphens instead. Clicking <kbd>OK</kbd> will post the post. It should then appear on the site soon.
